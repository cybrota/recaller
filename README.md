## Getting Started

### Installing Recaller

**Install Script (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybrota/recaller/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Or via HomeBrew (Ideal for macOS users)**
```bash
brew tap cybrota/cybrota
brew install recaller
```

**Or build from source** (requires Go 1.18+)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybrota/recaller.git
cd recaller && go build -o recaller . && sudo mv recaller /usr/local/bin/
```

### Configuring Your Project

**Shell Configuration** (Required for Bash users)
- **Bash**: Follow [setup guide](docs/setup-bash.md) to enable timestamped history
- **Zsh**: Works out of the box, see [setup guide](docs/setup-zsh.md) for optimization

**Configuration** (Optional)
Create `~/.recaller.yaml` to customize search behavior:
```yaml
history:
  # Default: true (fuzzy search - matches substring anywhere)
  enable_fuzzing: true
  # Set to false for prefix-based search only
  # enable_fuzzing: false

filesystem:
  # Enable filesystem search functionality
  enabled: true
  # Maximum number of files to index (default: 100000)
  max_indexed_files: 100000
  # Bloom filter settings for memory efficiency
  bloom_filter_size: 1000000
  bloom_filter_hashes: 5
  # Patterns to ignore during indexing
  ignore_patterns:
    - "*.tmp"
    - "*.log"
    - ".git"
    - "node_modules"
    - ".DS_Store"

# Reduce the verbosity of app. Default is false.
quiet: true
```

## Usage

### Command History Search
```bash
recaller                    # Launch interactive command history search
recaller run                # Same as above
recaller history            # View history with filtering
```

### Filesystem Search
```bash
# Index directories for filesystem search
recaller fs index                    # Index current directory recursively
recaller fs index ~/Documents        # Index specific directory recursively
recaller fs index /usr/local ~/code  # Index multiple directories recursively

# Launch filesystem search UI
recaller fs                          # Launch search UI (auto re-indexes tracked paths)

# Manage filesystem index
recaller fs clean --stale            # Remove entries for deleted files
recaller fs clean --older-than 30    # Remove entries older than 30 days
recaller fs clean --clear            # Clear entire index
recaller fs clean --dry-run          # Preview what would be cleaned
```

### Configuration
```bash
recaller settings list      # View current configuration settings
recaller version            # Check version
```
