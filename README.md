## üöÄ Installation

**Install Script (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybrota/recaller/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Or via HomeBrew (Ideal for macOS users)**
```bash
brew tap cybrota/cybrota
brew install recaller
```

**Or build from source** (requires Go 1.18+)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybrota/recaller.git
cd recaller && go build -o recaller . && sudo mv recaller /usr/local/bin/
```

## üîß Setup

**Shell Configuration** (Required for Bash users)
- **Bash**: Follow [setup guide](docs/setup-bash.md) to enable timestamped history
- **Zsh**: Works out of the box, see [setup guide](docs/setup-zsh.md) for optimization

**Search Configuration** (Optional)
Create `~/.recaller.yaml` to customize search behavior:
```yaml
history:
  # Default: true (fuzzy search - matches substring anywhere)
  enable_fuzzing: true

  # Set to false for prefix-based search only
  # enable_fuzzing: false
```

**Usage**
```bash
recaller                    # Launch interactive search
recaller history            # View history with filtering
recaller settings list      # View current configuration settings
recaller version            # Check version
```

## üîç Search Modes

**Fuzzy Search** (Default)
- Matches commands containing your search query **anywhere**
- More intuitive and finds commands with keywords in any position
- Example: `commit` matches `git commit -m "fix"`, `pre-commit run`, etc.

**Prefix Search** (Configurable)
- Matches commands that **start with** your search query
- Fast and efficient for finding commands by their beginning
- Example: `git` matches `git status`, `git commit`, etc.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Copy to clipboard | `Ctrl+E` | Execute in terminal |
| `‚Üë/‚Üì` | Navigate | `Tab` | Switch panels |
| `F1` | Show help | `Esc` | Quit |

## üîí Privacy & Security

**Your data stays local**: Recaller processes your command history entirely on your machine. No data is sent to external servers or cloud services. Your command history remains private and secure.

## üìã Requirements
